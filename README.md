An authentification (Zend_Auth) Adapter for use with a MongoDB (NoSQL) Database.

TODO:

Redo the credential treatement part. Right know it's hardcoded and does only check if a salt was provided. Maybe could allow use to choose between md5 with salt and crypt, with a preference for crypt.

Feedback is welcome ;) Use the Github Issues system or visite me @ http://www.chris.lu
